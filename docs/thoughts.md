TF-IDF not a very effective metric for small corpus. Most words end up having the same value.

Using ML to determine salient words from text, POS tagging/TF-IDF simply not good enough at identifying important words in a sentence.

Retrieving an icon, taking context into account. (Homonyms, not ..)

Is layout really important? If coherence is necessary, then no-overlap is a must.

Strokes & Mood lines - Is there a way we can implement style transfer based on stroke style?

How can we use GANs in this case to compare different arrangements?

GANs seem to be most useful at generating data, given a small amount of tattoos, can we use it to generate more tattoo like images, and then use the generated images for style transfer?
